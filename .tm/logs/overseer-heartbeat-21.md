# Overseer Heartbeat 21

**Time:** 2026-02-10T22:27:26.528Z
**Summary:** No intervention needed. Task erdos728b-zws is progressing through scoping and cardinality proofs.
**Details:** Summary of observations:
1. **Active Progress**: Task `erdos728b-zws` (highDigitCount_eq) is `in_progress`. The agent is currently fixing scoping errors related to the prime hypothesis `hp` to enable bijections between `DigitSpace` and `Nat` digits.
2. **Pipeline Health**: The Priority 0 track is moving through the high-digit chain (`zws` -> `2wo`). The cascade chain (`s9h`) just finished, unblocking `rw2` (once the high-digit chain catches up).
3. **Metrics**: Sorry count remains at 10. Compilation is healthy.
4. **Interventions**: No stale, failed, or orphaned tasks detected.
