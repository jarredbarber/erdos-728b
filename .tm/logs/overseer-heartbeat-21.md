# Overseer Heartbeat 21

**Time:** 2026-02-11T05:25:46.335Z
**Summary:** No intervention needed. Task erdos728b-hga is making steady progress, having already proven the invariance of cascade length and high digit count under mod p^D. Tier 0 leaf tasks remain unblocked.
**Details:** Sorry count: 13. Task hga is active and has successfully implemented mod-invariance helpers for the bad residue set argument. The remaining Tier 0 and Tier 1 tasks in the DAG are correctly unblocked. Compilation is stable.
