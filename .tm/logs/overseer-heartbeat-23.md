**Summary:** System healthy. Priority 0 integration chain is flowing correctly.
**Details:** Summary of observations:
1. **Pipeline Flow**: Task `erdos728b-zws` (highDigitCount_eq) was closed successfully. The worker has transitioned to `erdos728b-2wo` (count_few_high_digits) on the Priority 0 track.
2. **Prioritization**: The worker correctly bypassed lower priority tasks (P1/P2) to work on the integration critical path (P0).
3. **Metrics**: Sorry count at 10. Axiom count at 0. Literature count at 5 verified/rejected proofs.
4. **No Issues**: No stale, failed, or orphaned tasks detected in this cycle. Building remains successful.
