**Summary:** Planner task aw0 completed in beehive (bh) namespace; migrated 13 granular formalization tasks to timtam (tm) for processing by the active worker. Established a clear 4-tier dependency DAG to close the remaining 18 sorries.
**Details:** 1. Sorry count: 18. 2. Migrated 13 tasks from bh to tm, including Tier 0 leaf tasks: zvo (Pri 0), tor, zs3, co5, 9pu, at0, hga. 3. Reopened 48g (union bound) as it is now correctly blocked by the new sub-lemma DAG (gaa -> v1n/g8b -> leaf tasks). 4. Task GUIDE.md contains detailed formalization instructions for each new task. 5. DAG is now healthy and unblocked for Tier 0 workers.
