# Overseer Heartbeat 6

**Time:** 2026-02-10T18:59:36.128Z
**Summary:** No intervention needed. Steady progress on Lemma 3 formalization.
**Details:** Task erdos728b-xd1 closed, providing lower bound on carries via high digits in Erdos/Digits.lean. Task erdos728b-vuz is actively formalizing the combinatorial Chernoff bound in Erdos/Lemma3.lean. Sorry count decreased from 6 to 4. DAG health is good; erdos728b-wv3 is poised to combine components once vuz completes.
