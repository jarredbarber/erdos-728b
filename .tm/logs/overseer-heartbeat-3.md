# Overseer Heartbeat 3

**Time:** 2026-02-10T18:11:33.852Z
**Summary:** No intervention needed. Healthy verify-revise cycle in progress.
**Details:** Task erdos728b-6mr (Formalize digit counting bijection) completed successfully, creating Erdos/Lemma3.lean and unblocking 3 downstream tasks. Verification requested revision of proofs/lemma3-counting.md for k vs m_0 relationship clarity - task erdos728b-pbc is actively addressing this. Sorry count increased 3→4 due to new skeleton in Lemma3.lean (normal intermediate state). No stale tasks detected.
