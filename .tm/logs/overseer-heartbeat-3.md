# Overseer Heartbeat 3

**Time:** 2026-02-10T21:27:52.882Z
**Summary:** Monitored Lemma 3 integration planning progress. No intervention needed.
**Details:** Summary of observations:
1. **Planning Progress**: Task `erdos728b-xs2` (planner) has successfully created 7 sub-tasks to decompose the Lemma 3 integration. These tasks cover cascade bounds, high-digit counting, and residue-class tiling in `Lemma3Counting.lean`.
2. **Task Pipeline**: The DAG is flowing. The worker is currently finalizing the plan. `erdos728b-cvq` (expectation_highIndicator) is at the top of the unblocked backlog and will be picked up next.
3. **Metrics**: Sorry count remains at 15. All files compile correctly with existing sorries.
4. **Memory Update**: Noted the 7/8 tasks created by the planner and the current pipeline state.
