# Overseer Heartbeat 20

**Time:** 2026-02-11T13:56:34.895Z
**Summary:** No intervention needed. Project 729 formalization is proceeding smoothly.
**Details:** Erdos 728b is complete and sorry-free. Erdos 729 is in the formalization phase: sumDigits_le_log and delta_le_sumDigits are proved. Task erdos728b-yta (proving a < 2n via Bertrand's Postulate) is currently in progress and nearly finished. Only one sorry hole remains in the main project (for the main theorem erdos_729). System is healthy.
