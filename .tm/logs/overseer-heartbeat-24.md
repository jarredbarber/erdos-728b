# Overseer Heartbeat 24

**Time:** 2026-02-10T22:39:03.011Z
**Summary:** Task count_bad_single_prime (rw2) completed. P0 track continues with residue_count_interval (9fz).
**Details:** Summary of observations:
1. **Pipeline Progress**: Task `erdos728b-rw2` (count_bad_single_prime) was successfully closed, resolving the main threshold argument for a single prime in `Erdos/Lemma3Counting.lean`. Task `erdos728b-9fz` (residue_count_interval) is now `in_progress` on the Priority 0 track.
2. **Metrics**: Sorry count decreased to 8. Axiom count remains at 0. literature count at 5 verified/rejected proofs.
3. **DAG Health**: The integration critical path is unblocked. `erdos728b-e6t` is waiting on `9fz` to complete its dependencies.
4. **No Action**: Pipeline is healthy and flowing correctly.
