# Overseer Heartbeat 2

**Time:** 2026-02-10T17:55:27.363Z
**Summary:** Recovered one stale task. Skeleton for Lemma 3 created.
**Details:** Task erdos728b-6mr (Formalize digit counting bijection) was stale for 31 minutes and has been recovered. The worker has successfully created Erdos/Lemma3.lean with a core skeleton of definitions and initial lemmas, but is currently stuck on a tactic-heavy proof. Sorry count is at 3. Verify task for the Lemma 3 NL proof remains open.
