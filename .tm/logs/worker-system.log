Find infinite $a,b,n$ with $a,b > \epsilon n$ such that $a!b! \mid n!(a+b-n)!$ and $C \log n < a+b-n < C' \log n$.

Hint: Use Legendre's formula.
The condition is equivalent to $S_p(n) + S_p(k) \le S_p(a) + S_p(b)$ for all primes $p$, where $k=a+b-n$.
This inequality relates to the number of carries.
Key idea: Choose $n$ specifically to avoid carries when adding $k$, while ensuring $a+b$ forces carries.
Consider $n = m! - 1$ or similar factorial constructions to simplify digit properties?"

[2026-02-10T14:45:08.689Z]    Summary: Created 2 tasks: 1 librarian task for Mathlib coverage and 1 explore task for NL proof strategy.
[2026-02-10T14:45:08.689Z]    Details: Gap analysis complete. The theorem requires constructing a,b,n satisfying divisibility conditions. The core idea likely involves digit sums in base p (Legendre's formula). Created librarian task to confirm available tools and explore task to develop the construction.

Find a new construction for infinitely many (a, b, n) with a!b! | n!(a+b-n)! and k = a+b-n in (C log n, C' log n).

[2026-02-10T15:33:48.185Z]    Summary: Rejected — proofs/erdos728.md
[2026-02-10T15:33:48.185Z]    Details: The construction in proofs/erdos728.md using $M=m!-1$ has a fundamental flaw. Specifically:
1. The set of 'bad primes' $\mathcal{P} = \{ p > m : p \mid \binom{M}{k} \}$ is too large. Its product $Q = \prod_{p \in \mathcal{P}} p \approx \binom{M}{k} \approx M^k$, which is much larger than $M$. Since CRT only guarantees a solution for $a$ in the range $[0, Q)$, it is highly unlikely that any solution exists in the required range $[0, M]$.
2. The density of valid $a$ values is approximately $\exp(-m(\log m)^2)$, which is much smaller than $1/M$ for large $m$.
3. For $p \le m$, the choice $M=m!-1$ implies $M \equiv -1 \pmod{p^L}$, which forces zero carries in the first $L$ positions for any $a+b=M$. This makes it impossible for $v_p(\binom{M}{a})$ to satisfy the divisibility condition for primes near $m$ where $v_p(\binom{M}{k}) > 0$ might occur.

The proof has been updated to 'Rejected ❌' and documented in proofs/dead-ends.md. A follow-up explore task (erdos728b-epq) has been created to find a new construction.
