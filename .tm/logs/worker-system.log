$ tm create -t "Develop NL proof strategy for Erdos 728" -r explore -p 1 --deps erdos728b-9ka -d "Statement:
Find infinite $a,b,n$ with $a,b > \epsilon n$ such that $a!b! \mid n!(a+b-n)!$ and $C \log n < a+b-n < C' \log n$.

Hint: Use Legendre's formula.
The condition is equivalent to $S_p(n) + S_p(k) \le S_p(a) + S_p(b)$ for all primes $p$, where $k=a+b-n$.
This inequality relates to the number of carries.
Key idea: Choose $n$ specifically to avoid carries when adding $k$, while ensuring $a+b$ forces carries.
Consider $n = m! - 1$ or similar factorial constructions to simplify digit properties?"

📊 Task erdos728b-xd6 completed:
[2026-02-10T14:45:08.689Z]    Summary: Created 2 tasks: 1 librarian task for Mathlib coverage and 1 explore task for NL proof strategy.
[2026-02-10T14:45:08.689Z]    Details: Gap analysis complete. The theorem requires constructing a,b,n satisfying divisibility conditions. The core idea likely involves digit sums in base p (Legendre's formula). Created librarian task to confirm available tools and explore task to develop the construction.
