Find infinite $a,b,n$ with $a,b > \epsilon n$ such that $a!b! \mid n!(a+b-n)!$ and $C \log n < a+b-n < C' \log n$.

Hint: Use Legendre's formula.
The condition is equivalent to $S_p(n) + S_p(k) \le S_p(a) + S_p(b)$ for all primes $p$, where $k=a+b-n$.
This inequality relates to the number of carries.
Key idea: Choose $n$ specifically to avoid carries when adding $k$, while ensuring $a+b$ forces carries.
Consider $n = m! - 1$ or similar factorial constructions to simplify digit properties?"

[2026-02-10T14:45:08.689Z]    Summary: Created 2 tasks: 1 librarian task for Mathlib coverage and 1 explore task for NL proof strategy.
[2026-02-10T14:45:08.689Z]    Details: Gap analysis complete. The theorem requires constructing a,b,n satisfying divisibility conditions. The core idea likely involves digit sums in base p (Legendre's formula). Created librarian task to confirm available tools and explore task to develop the construction.

[2026-02-10T15:33:48.185Z]    Summary: Rejected — proofs/erdos728.md
[2026-02-10T15:33:48.185Z]    Details: The construction in proofs/erdos728.md using $M=m!-1$ has a fundamental flaw. Specifically:
1. The set of 'bad primes' $\mathcal{P} = \{ p > m : p \mid \binom{M}{k} \}$ is too large. Its product $Q = \prod_{p \in \mathcal{P}} p \approx \binom{M}{k} \approx M^k$, which is much larger than $M$. Since CRT only guarantees a solution for $a$ in the range $[0, Q)$, it is highly unlikely that any solution exists in the required range $[0, M]$.
2. The density of valid $a$ values is approximately $\exp(-m(\log m)^2)$, which is much smaller than $1/M$ for large $m$.
3. For $p \le m$, the choice $M=m!-1$ implies $M \equiv -1 \pmod{p^L}$, which forces zero carries in the first $L$ positions for any $a+b=M$. This makes it impossible for $v_p(\binom{M}{a})$ to satisfy the divisibility condition for primes near $m$ where $v_p(\binom{M}{k}) > 0$ might occur.

The proof has been updated to 'Rejected ❌' and documented in proofs/dead-ends.md. A follow-up explore task (erdos728b-epq) has been created to find a new construction.

[2026-02-10T16:02:59.640Z]    Summary: Proved Erdős 728. Published to proofs/erdos728_v2.md
[2026-02-10T16:02:59.640Z]    Details: Confidence: High. The proof uses three key ingredients:

1. **Reduction (Lemma 1)**: Setting a=m, b=m+k, n=2m, the divisibility a!b! | n!k! reduces to binom(m+k,k) | binom(2m,m).

2. **Carry Dominance Lemma (Lemma 2)**: For primes p > 2k and ANY m, v_p(binom(m+k,k)) ≤ v_p(binom(2m,m)). Proof by induction: every carry in m+k implies a carry in m+m at the same position (since p > 2k forces m_0 > p/2 when there's a carry at position 0, and cascading carries through p-1 digits work for both additions).

3. **Probabilistic argument (Lemma 3 + union bound)**: For primes p ≤ 2k, the failure probability is exponentially small in D_p = log_p(m), because v_p(binom(2m,m)) ~ D_p/2 while v_p(binom(m+k,k)) ≤ log_p(k) + cascade_length. A union bound over π(2k) ≤ 2k primes shows total failure probability < 1 for m_0 sufficiently large.

This approach avoids CRT entirely (which was the bottleneck of the previous M=m!-1 construction) and works for all C > 0.

[2026-02-10T16:05:16.725Z]    Summary: Proved sieve lemma for avoiding forbidden residues in a long interval. Published to proofs/sieve-lemma.md
[2026-02-10T16:05:16.725Z]    Details: Confidence: Certain. The proof uses the Legendre sieve (inclusion-exclusion + CRT) to count admissible integers in [X,Y] that avoid forbidden residue classes modulo each prime in a finite set P. The result is structured as: Theorem 1 (exact count with error bound), Corollary 1 (sufficient condition via main term > error), Corollary 2 (simplified: N·∏(1-f_p/p) > ∏(1+f_p)-1), Corollary 3 (clean threshold for Erdős 728), and Corollary 4 (asymptotic: when k = O(log N) and |P| = π(2k), the threshold is o(N^ε), so the condition holds for large N). The connection to Erdős 728 is spelled out: for primes p > 2k, carry dominance holds automatically; for p ≤ 2k, the forbidden residues F_p^(0) = {r : r+k₀ ≥ p and r < ⌈p/2⌉} have bounded size, and the sieve guarantees existence of admissible m in [m₀, 2m₀].
