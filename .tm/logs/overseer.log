[2026-02-10T23:47:18.643Z] 💓 Heartbeat #39 complete: Verified DAG health and prioritized the Lemma 3 integration chain. Task erdos728b-7ee is currently in progress, formalizing the residue section helper lemmas, although the build is temporarily broken in Erdos/Lemma3Counting.lean due to ongoing edits. The sorry count stands at 15.

[2026-02-10T23:59:41.221Z] 💓 Heartbeat #42 complete: Verified DAG health and intervened to resolve a critical build regression. Task erdos728b-4tm failed as it was unable to maintain a compilable state in Erdos/Lemma3Counting.lean due to scoping and missing identifier errors introduced by task 7ee. Created erdos728b-zzq (Sanitize and Fix Lemma3Counting.lean) to restore the build and wired it as a dependency for the main theorem integration.

[2026-02-11T00:03:11.297Z] 💓 Heartbeat #43 complete: Verified project health and maintained the priority track. Task erdos728b-zzq (Sanitize and Fix Lemma3Counting.lean) is currently open and unblocked, acting as the primary bottleneck for the existence theorem integration. Task erdos728b-4tm failed and its responsibilities have been partially shifted to the sanitization task. Task erdos728b-6a3 is in progress but struggling with build regressions.

[2026-02-11T00:11:20.283Z] 💓 Heartbeat #45 complete: Reset the Priority 0 track due to critical build regressions in Lemma3Counting.lean. Reopened erdos728b-zzq (Sanitize) and erdos728b-4tm (Interval bound) to resolve scoping and identifier errors. Task erdos728b-6a3 (Chernoff) completed successfully.

[2026-02-11T00:23:45.718Z] 💓 Heartbeat #48 complete: Verified that Erdos/Lemma3Counting.lean build has been restored by task erdos728b-zzq. The sorry count has dropped to 13 as many previously sorried lemmas now have correct logic. Erdos/Lemma3.lean remains sorry-free. The Priority 0 track is unblocked and moving towards completion.

[2026-02-11T00:27:18.259Z] 💓 Heartbeat #49 complete: Verified that Erdos/Lemma3.lean is now sorry-free. Erdos/Lemma3Counting.lean build has been restored and sanitized by task erdos728b-zzq. Re-triggered the closure of erdos728b-zzq with explicit instructions to fix its status block, and confirmed that the Priority 0 track (Interval bound -> Main Existence) is unblocked.
