Task erdos728b-7ee is currently in progress, formalizing the residue section helper lemmas, although the build is temporarily broken in Erdos/Lemma3Counting.lean due to ongoing edits. The sorry count stands at 15.

[2026-02-10T23:59:41.221Z] 💓 Heartbeat #42 complete: Verified DAG health and intervened to resolve a critical build regression. Task erdos728b-4tm failed as it was unable to maintain a compilable state in Erdos/Lemma3Counting.lean due to scoping and missing identifier errors introduced by task 7ee. Created erdos728b-zzq (Sanitize and Fix Lemma3Counting.lean) to restore the build and wired it as a dependency for the main theorem integration.

Task erdos728b-zzq (Sanitize and Fix Lemma3Counting.lean) is currently open and unblocked, acting as the primary bottleneck for the existence theorem integration. Task erdos728b-4tm failed and its responsibilities have been partially shifted to the sanitization task. Task erdos728b-6a3 is in progress but struggling with build regressions.
