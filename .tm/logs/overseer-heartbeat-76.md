# Overseer Heartbeat 76

**Time:** 2026-02-11T17:51:32.386Z
**Summary:** No intervention needed. Project stabilized and sub-tasks unblocked.
**Details:** The project has been reset to a stable compiling state. Erdos/Problem729.lean now contains only sorry-skeletons for the 4 bridging lemmas (nat_log_le_real_log, log_n_le_log_n_plus_2, sumDigits_bound_real, sumDigits_log_bound). Stray files were removed. The formalizers are now free to implement these lemmas correctly one-by-one. Compilation is successful. Sorry count: 6.
