**Summary:** No intervention needed. Project 729 is awaiting decomposition by the planner.
**Details:** Erdős 728b is complete. Erdős 729 is at a tactical roadblock: task erdos728b-sms (the monolithic proof) has failed, and erdos728b-vyc (planner) is unblocked to decompose it into manageable sub-lemmas. Sorry count in the project is 1. Axiom count is 0.
