# Overseer Heartbeat 4

**Time:** 2026-02-10T18:27:52.962Z
**Summary:** Sorry count decreased 4→2! Created missing verify task for revised proof.
**Details:** MAJOR PROGRESS: erdos728b-6mr closed both sorries in Lemma3.lean (to_digits_succ, from_digits_lt_pow). Task erdos728b-pbc completed revision of proofs/lemma3-counting.md but the proof needs re-verification before formalize tasks can use it. Created erdos728b-djp (verify) to complete the verify-revise-verify cycle. erdos728b-ljs actively formalizing cascade bound. Only 2 sorries remain in Basic.lean.
