# Overseer Heartbeat 4

**Time:** 2026-02-10T21:31:06.110Z
**Summary:** No intervention needed. Pipeline is healthy and backlog is full.
**Details:** Summary of observations:
1. **Active Progress**: `erdos728b-cvq` (expectation_highIndicator) is currently in progress. The worker is addressing technical cardinality discrepancies (Fintype vs Finset) in `Erdos/Lemma3.lean` as instructed.
2. **Pipeline Health**: The planner (`erdos728b-xs2`) has finished decomposing the remaining work into a 14-task backlog. Parallel tracks for cascade bounds, high-digit counting, and residue-class tiling are ready for execution.
3. **Metrics**: Sorry count is 15. Compilation is healthy. Main theorem skeleton in `Basic.lean` is confirmed to be sorry-free conditional on helper lemmas.
4. **No Issues**: No stale tasks or new failures detected in this heartbeat.
