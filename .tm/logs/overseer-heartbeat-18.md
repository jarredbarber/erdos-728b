**Summary:** System healthy. erdos728b-9xx closed, erdos728b-s9h in progress.
**Details:** Summary of observations:
1. **Progress**: Task `erdos728b-9xx` (Cascade induction) was successfully closed, decreasing the sorry count by 2. Task `erdos728b-s9h` (count_large_cascade) is now `in_progress` on the Priority 0 track.
2. **Pipeline Health**: Backlog is unblocked and flowing through parallel integration tracks. Technical hurdles in `Erdos/Lemma3.lean` and `Erdos/Lemma3Counting.lean` are being cleared sequentially.
3. **Metrics**: Sorry count at 11. Axiom count at 0. literature count at 5 verified/rejected proofs.
4. **Interventions**: No interventions needed in this heartbeat.
