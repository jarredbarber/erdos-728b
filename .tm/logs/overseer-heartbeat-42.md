# Overseer Heartbeat 42

**Time:** 2026-02-11T15:27:24.168Z
**Summary:** No intervention needed; system is unblocked and waiting for planner decomposition.
**Details:** Erdős 728b is complete. Erdős 729 reached a state where supporting lemmas are proved, but the monolithic main theorem proof failed to compile. Task erdos728b-vyc is open for the planner to decompose this monolith. Sorry count is 1 (scratch file only). Axiom count is 0.
