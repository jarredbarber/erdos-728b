# Overseer Heartbeat 25

**Time:** 2026-02-10T22:42:30.641Z
**Summary:** Task erdos728b-2wo (count_few_high_digits) completed. Priority 0 track moving to residue interval counting.
**Details:** Summary of observations:
1. **Pipeline Success**: Task `erdos728b-2wo` (count_few_high_digits) was closed successfully, resolving the high-digit track of the single-prime bound. The Priority 0 track has now transitioned to `erdos728b-9fz` (residue_count_interval), which is the first step in lifting local bounds to the interval [m0, 2m0].
2. **Active Progress**: The formalization agent is currently working on `Erdos/Lemma3Residue.lean`, implementing the division-based counting bound for residues in an interval.
3. **Metrics**: Sorry count decreased from 10 to 8. Build is healthy.
4. **No Issues**: No stale, failed, or orphaned tasks detected in this cycle.
