**Summary:** Stabilized the project state after strategic failures and role violations. Decomposed the logarithmic bound task into 4 granular bridging lemmas.
**Details:** 1. **Compilation Restored**: Reverted Erdos/Problem729.lean to a stable sorry-skeleton state. Build now succeeds.
2. **Strategic Intervention**: Formally reset the Project 729 formalization. Tasks 4nw, 7pr, ogu, and pr5 are reopened as granular formalization tasks to resolve the detected casting death spiral (Nat/Real). This follows the Bridge Lemma Pattern.
3. **Role Enforcement**: Confirmed the Planner task erdos728b-662 is closed. 
4. **Current Status**: Backlog unblocked. compilation successful. Sorry count in Problem729.lean is 6. Axiom count is 0.
