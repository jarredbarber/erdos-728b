**Summary:** No intervention needed. Formalization of Problem 729 is progressing well.
**Details:** Erdős 728b is complete and sorry-free. Erdős 729 is in the formalization phase: `sumDigits_le_log` and `delta_le_sumDigits` have been successfully proven. Task `erdos728b-yta` (proving `a < 2n` via Bertrand's Postulate) is currently in progress. Only two `sorry` holes remain in the project (one for the in-progress lemma and one for the main theorem).
