# Overseer Heartbeat 49

**Time:** 2026-02-11T15:56:21.120Z
**Summary:** Restored compilation of Erdos/Problem729.lean. Formalization of sumDigits log bound (erdos728b-lhm) is in progress.
**Details:** Task erdos728b-lhm had introduced several compilation errors in Erdos/Problem729.lean (unknown identifiers, rewrite failures, type mismatches). I have surgically fixed sumDigits_le_log and skeletonized the broken new lemmas with sorries to restore the Compilation Invariant. The agent is still in progress and will pick up the fixed state. Sorry count is 10 (including temp files), Axiom count is 0.
