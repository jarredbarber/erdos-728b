**Summary:** No intervention needed. Waiting for the planner to decompose the Erdos 729 monolith.
**Details:** The project reached a state where Erdos/Problem729.lean is sorry-free but non-compiling with many errors. Task erdos728b-vyc (planner) is open to decompose the monolithic proof into manageable sub-lemmas. System is currently idle waiting for worker assignment.
