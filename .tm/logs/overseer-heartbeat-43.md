# Overseer Heartbeat 43

**Time:** 2026-02-11T00:03:11.296Z
**Summary:** Verified project health and maintained the priority track. Task erdos728b-zzq (Sanitize and Fix Lemma3Counting.lean) is currently open and unblocked, acting as the primary bottleneck for the existence theorem integration. Task erdos728b-4tm failed and its responsibilities have been partially shifted to the sanitization task. Task erdos728b-6a3 is in progress but struggling with build regressions.
**Details:** Sorry count: 17. Literature count: 6. Build status: Massive regressions in Lemma3Counting.lean (sanitization task erdos728b-zzq created to resolve). Main track: zzq (Fix build) -> Interval bound retry -> hwa (Existence theorem).
