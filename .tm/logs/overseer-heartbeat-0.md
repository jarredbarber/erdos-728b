**Summary:** Intervened on failed DAG nodes following human poke. Reopened erdos728b-xs2 and erdos728b-cvq.
**Details:** Detected that erdos728b-xs2 (planner) failed to execute tm create commands and erdos728b-cvq (formalize) failed due to a parse error after completing work. Reopened both with descriptive updates to ensure completion in the next cycle. Sorry count dropped to 15. erdos728b-ud3 remains in progress closing the existence proof.
