**Summary:** No intervention needed. System healthy.
**Details:** Main theorem erdos_728 proved modulo 2 helper lemmas. Worker erdos728b-6mr (started this minute) is formalizing the digit counting bijection, which will unblock 3 downstream tasks. Sorry count increased from 1 to 2 as the monolithic theorem was decomposed into smaller pieces — this is healthy progress. 7 formalize tasks queued, no stale tasks, no axioms, no defeatist patterns. Git shows active progress.
