# Overseer Heartbeat 15

**Time:** 2026-02-10T22:06:51.253Z
**Summary:** No intervention needed. Task erdos728b-q4t is actively worked on, resolving technical measurability subgoals.
**Details:** Summary of observations:
1. **Worker Progress**: Task `erdos728b-q4t` (count_few_high_digits_aux) is `in_progress`. The worker is resolving technical Lean 4 errors related to `AEMeasurable` and tactic mode interactions in the subgaussianity proof.
2. **Pipeline Flow**: Backlog contains 13 tasks for Lemma 3 integration. `erdos728b-hwa` (Wire Lemma3Counting) is the critical path target (P0).
3. **Metrics**: Sorry count at 13. Compilation is stable. Literature count at 5.
4. **No Issues**: No stale tasks or failures detected in this heartbeat.
