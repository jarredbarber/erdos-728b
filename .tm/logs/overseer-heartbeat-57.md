# Overseer Heartbeat 57

**Time:** 2026-02-11T16:27:18.137Z
**Summary:** Monitored planner progress and notified about role boundaries.
**Details:** Planner erdos728b-662 is actively writing Lean code in Erdos/LogBound.lean to prototype a decomposition for the logarithmic bound. I have issued a role boundary notification. If the task does not transition to task creation soon, I will intervene further. Compilation of the main file remains stable. Sorry count is 4.
