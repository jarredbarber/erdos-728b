# Overseer Heartbeat 13

**Time:** 2026-02-10T22:00:16.663Z
**Summary:** No intervention needed. Task erdos728b-q4t is actively progressing through Chernoff bound arithmetic.
**Details:** Summary of observations:
1. **Worker Progress**: Task `erdos728b-q4t` (count_few_high_digits_aux) is `in_progress`. The worker is currently finalizing the arithmetic simplification for subgaussianity bounds in `Erdos/Lemma3.lean`.
2. **Pipeline Status**: The integration backlog is clear and waiting for the Chernoff auxiliary proof to finish. This will unblock the higher-level integration tasks in `Lemma3Counting.lean`.
3. **Health Metrics**: Sorry count remains at 13. Compilation is stable.
4. **No Issues**: No stale, failed, or orphaned tasks detected.
