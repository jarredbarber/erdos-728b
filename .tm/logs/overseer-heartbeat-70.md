# Overseer Heartbeat 70

**Time:** 2026-02-11T17:23:58.052Z
**Summary:** No intervention needed. Erdős 729 formalization is proceeding through granular bridging lemmas.
**Details:** The strategy to decompose the monolithic log bound task into 4 bridging lemmas (4nw, 7pr, ogu, pr5) is working. 4nw, 7pr, and ogu are now closed and sorry-free in Erdos/Problem729.lean. Task pr5 (sumDigits_log_bound) is currently in progress. Compilation is successful. Sorry count: 3. Axiom count: 0.
