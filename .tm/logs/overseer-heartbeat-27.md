# Overseer Heartbeat 27

**Time:** 2026-02-11T14:25:45.513Z
**Summary:** Project 729 is sorry-free but failing compilation; erdos728b-sms is actively debugging.
**Details:** All supporting lemmas for Erdos 729 are closed. Task erdos728b-sms has removed all sorries from the main project but is currently resolving type casting and name interpretation errors in the final proof. Since it is the only active task, it is not blocking others. System is healthy and moving toward completion.
