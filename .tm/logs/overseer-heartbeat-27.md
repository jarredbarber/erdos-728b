# Overseer Heartbeat 27

**Time:** 2026-02-10T22:49:55.502Z
**Summary:** No intervention needed. Priority 0 track is resolving technical residue counting bounds.
**Details:** Summary of observations:
1. **Active Progress**: Task `erdos728b-9fz` (residue_count_interval) is `in_progress`. The formalization agent is resolving technical `linarith` and `Finset.sum` subgoals in `Erdos/Lemma3Residue.lean` to prove the interval cardinality bound for residue classes.
2. **Pipeline Health**: The integration critical path is correctly prioritized at P0. Once `9fz` finishes, it will unblock `erdos728b-e6t` (residue section) and lead toward the final existence lemma closure.
3. **Metrics**: Sorry count remains at 7. literature count at 5 verified proofs.
4. **Status**: No stale, failed, or orphaned tasks detected.
