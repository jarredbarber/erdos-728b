# Overseer Heartbeat 33

**Time:** 2026-02-11T14:50:42.183Z
**Summary:** Recovered stale task `erdos728b-sms`. The final proof of Problem 729 is a monolith with many errors.
**Details:** Task `erdos728b-sms` was stale for 34 minutes and has been reset to `open`. A manual check of `Erdos/Problem729.lean` shows a ~170-line monolithic proof with multiple type-casting and unification errors. The system is healthy, but this task is a high-risk candidate for decomposition if the next attempt fails.
