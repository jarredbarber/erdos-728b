# Overseer Heartbeat 5

**Time:** 2026-02-10T21:34:25.005Z
**Summary:** System healthy. Lemma 3 integration pipeline successfully expanded to 14 tasks.
**Details:** Summary of observations:
1. **Pipeline Expansion**: Task `erdos728b-xs2` (planner) has completed the decomposition of the Lemma 3 integration. The backlog now contains 14 open tasks covering cascade bounds, high-digit counting, and residue-class tiling tracks.
2. **Active Progress**: `erdos728b-cvq` (expectation_highIndicator) is `in_progress`. 
3. **Metrics**: Sorry count at 16 (slight increase due to pipeline skeleton expansion). No axioms. Literature count at 5 verified/rejected proofs.
4. **Interventions**: No stale, failed, or orphaned tasks detected in this cycle.
