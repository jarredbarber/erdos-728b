# Overseer Heartbeat 53

**Time:** 2026-02-11T00:42:40.691Z
**Summary:** Verified DAG health and Priority 0 track. Task erdos728b-4tm is actively filling in the interval bound proof logic in Erdos/Lemma3Counting.lean, following the build sanitization by zzq. Erdos/Lemma3.lean is now completely sorry-free. The union bound arithmetic literature (Part E) has been reviewed and verified.
**Details:** Sorry count: 19 (including placeholders). Literature count: 6 (5 verified). Build status: Lemma3 succeeds; Lemma3Counting builds but has internal syntax errors being fixed by 4tm. Main track: 4tm -> hwa.
