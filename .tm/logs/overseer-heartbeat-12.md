# Overseer Heartbeat 12

**Time:** 2026-02-10T21:57:04.987Z
**Summary:** No intervention needed. Task erdos728b-q4t is actively progressing through technical technical Chernoff bound rewrites.
**Details:** Summary of observations:
1. **Active Progress**: Task `erdos728b-q4t` (Chernoff aux) is currently `in_progress`. The worker is resolving technical measure-theoretic goals in `Erdos/Lemma3.lean`, specifically subgaussianity proofs for the combinatorial Chernoff bound.
2. **Pipeline Health**: The 14-task integration backlog is clear. Once `q4t` closes, it will unblock the Chernoff citation axiom closure.
3. **Metrics**: Sorry count decreased to 13. Compilation is healthy. literature count at 5.
4. **No Issues**: No stale tasks or failures detected in this heartbeat.
