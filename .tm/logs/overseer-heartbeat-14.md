# Overseer Heartbeat 14

**Time:** 2026-02-10T22:03:38.132Z
**Summary:** No action needed. Worker is making steady progress on technical Chernoff proof.
**Details:** Summary of observations:
1. **Active Progress**: Task `erdos728b-q4t` (Chernoff aux) is currently `in_progress`. The worker is resolving technical measure-theoretic goals in `Erdos/Lemma3.lean` related to `AEMeasurable` and `integral` calculations for subgaussianity.
2. **Pipeline Health**: The DAG is flowing correctly. Backlog is full with 13 open integration tasks.
3. **Metrics**: Sorry count at 13. Compilation is stable. Literature count at 5.
4. **No Issues**: No stale, failed, or orphaned tasks detected.
