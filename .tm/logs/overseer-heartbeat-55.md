# Overseer Heartbeat 55

**Time:** 2026-02-11T00:50:16.248Z
**Summary:** Verified DAG health and Priority 0 track. Task erdos728b-hwa is currently in progress, integrating Lemma 3 into the main theorem. However, a build regression was detected in Erdos/Lemma3Counting.lean (broken calc blocks and decidability issues). Created a new Priority 0 task erdos728b-yzu to sanitize and fix the build again, and added it as a dependency for the main theorem task.
**Details:** Sorry count: 20. literature count: 6 (5 verified). Build status: Regressed in Lemma3Counting.lean. Interventions: Created yzu (p:0) to fix build; updated hwa dependencies.
