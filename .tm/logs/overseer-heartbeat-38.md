**Summary:** No intervention needed. Backlog correctly contains a high-priority planner task for decomposition.
**Details:** Erdős 728b is complete. Erdős 729 reached zero sorries but the monolithic proof failed to compile. Task erdos728b-vyc is unblocked for the planner to decompose the theorem. Sorry count is 1. Axiom count is 0.
