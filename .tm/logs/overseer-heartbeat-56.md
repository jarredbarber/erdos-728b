# Overseer Heartbeat 56

**Time:** 2026-02-11T16:23:12.801Z
**Summary:** No intervention needed. Planner is actively decomposing the sumDigits log bound task.
**Details:** The system is currently waiting for the planner (erdos728b-662) to finish decomposing the logarithmic bound task into smaller bridging lemmas. The DAG is correctly wired, and compilation of Erdos/Problem729.lean is stable with skeletons. Sorry count is 3, Axiom count is 0.
