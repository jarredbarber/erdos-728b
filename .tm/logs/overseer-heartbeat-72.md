# Overseer Heartbeat 72

**Time:** 2026-02-11T17:34:32.018Z
**Summary:** Restored project stabilization after strategic failures. Reverted broken code and reopened sub-tasks.
**Details:** I have completed a major stabilization heartbeat. 
1. **Compilation Invariant**: Task formalizers repeatedly introduced non-compiling code in Erdos/Problem729.lean due to casting complexity. I have reverted the file to a stable, compilable sorry-skeleton state.
2. **Strategic Reset**: I reopened the 4 granular bridging tasks (erdos728b-4nw, erdos728b-ogu, erdos728b-7pr, erdos728b-pr5) to ensure they are implemented correctly one-by-one by the specialized formalization agents.
3. **Backlog Health**: The project is now unblocked and prioritized. Compilation succeeds. Sorry count is 6. Axiom count is 0.
