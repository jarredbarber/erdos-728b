**Time:** 2026-02-10T23:47:18.642Z
**Summary:** Verified DAG health and prioritized the Lemma 3 integration chain. Task erdos728b-7ee is currently in progress, formalizing the residue section helper lemmas, although the build is temporarily broken in Erdos/Lemma3Counting.lean due to ongoing edits. The sorry count stands at 15.
**Details:** Sorry count: 15. Literature count: 6. Build status: Broken in Lemma3Counting.lean (erdos728b-7ee in progress). Priority 0 track: Residue helper lemmas (7ee) -> Interval bound (4tm) -> Existence theorem (hwa). Open tasks: Review union bound (wk2), Chernoff citation (6a3), probability counting (9s7).
