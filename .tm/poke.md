# Poke Notes

## Task scope (2026-02-10 16:00 UTC)

erdos728b-epq ("New construction for Erdos 728") — monitor for scope creep. If it's iterating through multiple complete proof strategies within a single task, it should fail and let the planner decompose. One construction per task.

Current status says "probabilistic existence proof over random m works for ALL C" — if it produces a single focused proof, fine. If it pivots again, kill it.
