- [2026-02-10 21:23] erdos728b-ud3 (Main Theorem) formalized (conditional on existence lemma).
- [2026-02-10 21:40] erdos728b-cvq (expectation_highIndicator) proven.
- [2026-02-10 22:12] erdos728b-q4t (Chernoff aux) proven via Hoeffding.
- [2026-02-10 22:42] Integration critical path track (P0): erdos728b-9fz (residue_count_interval) in progress.
- [2026-02-10 23:05] erdos728b-9fz reset with hint for fiberwise summation. Pipeline healthy, flowing correctly through technical subgoals.
