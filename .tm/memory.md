- [2026-02-11 00:30] Lemma3Counting.lean build fixed (erdos728b-5sw).
- [2026-02-11 00:45] erdos728b-7ee (Residue helpers) closed but introduced significant regressions (Unknown identifier `hp`, etc.).

- [2026-02-11 01:10] Created erdos728b-zzq (Sanitize and Fix) as Priority 0 blocker for existence theorem (hwa).
- [2026-02-11 01:15] erdos728b-6a3 is in progress but struggling with build errors.
