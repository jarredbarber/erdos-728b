- [2026-02-10 21:14] Detected pattern: Multiple formalization tasks failing with "parsed but JSON missing" or technical notation mismatches (Fintype vs Finset card).
- [2026-02-10 21:23] erdos728b-ud3 (Main Theorem) manually closed after verifying completion in logs.
- [2026-02-10 21:23] erdos728b-ud3 structure: erdos_728 proved via exists_good_m, proved via exists_m_choose_dvd_uniform (sorry) + log_gap_bounds (proved).
- [2026-02-10 21:30] erdos728b-xs2 (planner) has created 7/8 tasks for Lemma 3 integration. Stuck on final task creation?
- [2026-02-10 21:30] Next priorities: expectation_highIndicator (cvq) and completing Lemma 3 integration pipeline.
- [2026-02-10 21:30] Sorry count: 15.
