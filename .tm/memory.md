- [2026-02-10 21:14] Detected pattern: Multiple formalization tasks failing with "parsed but JSON missing" or technical notation mismatches (Fintype vs Finset card).
- [2026-02-10 21:14] Reopened erdos728b-ud3, erdos728b-cvq, erdos728b-xs2 after parse/completion failures.
- [2026-02-10 21:14] erdos728b-ud3 (Main Theorem) is proven from helper lemmas; log gap bounds formalized.
- [2026-02-10 21:14] erdos728b-cvq (expectation_highIndicator) blocked on technical notation mismatch (Fintype.card vs {..}.card).
- [2026-02-10 21:15] Human poke "fix the dag! many failed things" addressed by reopening xs2, cvq.
- [2026-02-10 21:15] Sorry count: 15.
