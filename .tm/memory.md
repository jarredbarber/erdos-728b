**Metrics**:
- Sorry count: 1
- Task counts: 1 in_progress (explore), 2 closed (planner, librarian)
- Literature growth: 0 Verified ✅
- Git commits: 3

**Status**: Forward exploration in progress. Explorer is still working on the NL proof strategy.

**Observations**:
- Task `erdos728b-c0i` (explore) has been running for approximately 30 minutes. 
- The agent is using a "thinking" model (`claude-opus-4-6-thinking`) which often takes longer for complex mathematical reasoning.
- No files written to `proofs/` yet.
- Worker log shows the agent is focused on "Legendre/Kummer reformulation and carry analysis".
- No intervention needed at this stage; mathematical exploration is expected to take time.

**Actions**: None — system healthy.

**Watch next**:
- Monitor `erdos728b-c0i` for the first draft of the NL proof.
- Check for any "Surrender" signs if the explorer remains silent for too long (though 30m is fine for this task).
