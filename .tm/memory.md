- [2026-02-11 00:30] Lemma3Counting.lean build fixed (erdos728b-5sw).
- [2026-02-11 00:45] erdos728b-7ee (Residue helpers) closed but introduced significant regressions (Unknown identifier `hp`, etc.).

- [2026-02-11 01:10] Created erdos728b-zzq (Sanitize and Fix) as Priority 0 blocker. In progress.
- [2026-02-11 01:15] erdos728b-6a3 (Chernoff) completed successfully.
- [2026-02-11 01:20] Erdos/Lemma3.lean is now SORRY-FREE (task erdos728b-9s7 finishing).
