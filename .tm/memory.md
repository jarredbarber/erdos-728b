- [2026-02-10 21:14] Detected pattern: Multiple formalization tasks failing with "parsed but JSON missing" or technical notation mismatches (Fintype vs Finset card).
- [2026-02-10 21:23] erdos728b-ud3 (Main Theorem) formalized (conditional on existence lemma).
- [2026-02-10 21:40] erdos728b-cvq (expectation_highIndicator) proven.
- [2026-02-10 22:12] erdos728b-q4t (Chernoff aux) proven via Hoeffding.

- [2026-02-10 23:45] Priority 0 track: Fixing Lemma3Counting (5sw) -> Integration helper lemmas (7ee) -> Interval bound (4tm) -> existence theorem (hwa).
- [2026-02-11 00:03] Task erdos728b-t4f closed. Review (wk2) unblocked.
