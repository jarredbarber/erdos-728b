**Metrics**:
- Sorry count: 6 (Basic.lean: 2; Lemma3.lean: 4)
- Task counts: 1 in_progress (formalize), 5 open, 26 closed
- Literature growth: 3 Verified ✅, 1 Rejected ❌
- Git commits: 34

**Status**: Forward progress steady. Lemma 3 formalization pipeline unblocked.

**Observations**:
- **SUCCESS**: `erdos728b-djp` verified `proofs/lemma3-counting.md`. The core NL proof is now solid.
- **SUCCESS**: `erdos728b-ljs` formalized the definitions and lemma statements for cascades in `Erdos/Lemma3.lean`.
- **SORRY STATUS**: Count increased 2→6 as the Lemma 3 skeleton grows. This is healthy decomposition.
- **ACTIVE FORMALIZATION**: `erdos728b-xd1` is working on the lower bound on carries via high digits.
- No stale tasks or axioms.

**Actions**: None.

**Watch next**:
- Monitor `erdos728b-xd1` and `erdos728b-vuz` progress on Lemma 3 sub-parts.
- Once Lemma 3 components are in, `erdos728b-wv3` will combine them.
