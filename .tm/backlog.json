{"id":"erdos728b-xd6","description":"Initial gap analysis and task decomposition\nRead PROBLEM.md and Erdos/Basic.lean. The theorem has one sorry (the entire proof).\n\nYour job:\n1. Understand the theorem statement — this is an EXISTENCE result (find a,b,n satisfying conditions)\n2. Read artifacts/ for any librarian findings (may be empty on first run)\n3. Create an initial task DAG:\n   - An explore task to develop a natural language proof strategy\n   - A librarian task to check Mathlib coverage for relevant domains (factorial divisibility, p-adic valuations, binomial coefficients)\n4. Do NOT create formalize tasks yet — we need NL proofs first\n\nThe theorem is known to be provable. Frame all tasks accordingly.","state":"open","role":"planner","priority":0,"isSystem":true,"dependencies":[],"createdAt":"2026-02-10T14:37:38.422Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-10T14:37:38.422Z"}
