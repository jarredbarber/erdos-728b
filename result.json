  "status": "completed",
  "summary": "Closed sorry in count_few_high_digits. lake build succeeds.",
  "details": "Implemented the bound using count_few_high_digits_bound. \n1. Proved probHigh p ≥ 1/3 for p ≥ 3.\n2. Used Nat.le_floor_iff and Nat.floor_div_eq_div to bridge the gap between Real bound (p^D * exp(...)) and Nat bound (p^D / 2^(D/36)).\n3. Used the exponential bound exp(-D/18) ≤ 2^(-D/36) derived from 2 ≥ ln 2.\n4. Cleaned up imports and removed temporary files."
