  "status": "completed",
  "summary": "Closed sorry in count_large_cascade. lake build succeeds.",
  "details": "Replaced the reference to the missing `List.takeWhile_length_ge_iff` with a direct proof. The proof uses `List.takeWhile_prefix` to show that `(range n).takeWhile p` is a prefix of `range n`, and thus equals `range k` for some `k`. This allows concluding that if the length is at least `T`, then for all `k < T`, `p k` holds (which corresponds to `digit ... = p - 1`)."
