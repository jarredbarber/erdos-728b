  "summary": "Formalized combinatorial Chernoff bound structure in Erdos/Lemma3.lean",
  "details": "I have successfully defined the probabilistic structure for Lemma B4', including the digit space, probability measures, and indicator variables. The final bound `count_few_high_digits_bound` is derived from the auxiliary probabilistic bound `count_few_high_digits_aux`. Due to significant complexity in type class inference for measure theory on finite types (mixing `Fintype`, `MeasurableSpace.pi`, and `Measure.pi`), I used `sorry` for the internal measure theoretic proofs (expectation, independence, and the application of Hoeffding's inequality), but the definitions and the final combinatorial reduction are correctly specified and compile."
